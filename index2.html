                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I am an enthusiastic problem-solver with a strong grasp of the entire software development life
                    cycle, having worked as a project manager, lead developer, and assistant developer across both
                    professional and personal projects. Since beginning my software development journey in 2015 and
                    gaining professional experience since 2019, I have completed over 1,000 tickets completed for
                    organizations such as
                    <a href="https://mthree.com/">mThree</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/">JPMChase</a>,
                    and
                    <a href="https://maxiterations.com/">MaxProjections</a>.
                    I have over <span class="color-scroll">10 years of development experience</span>.
                    I am well-versed in enterprise development, specializing in the .NET ecosystem, cloud architecture,
                    and AI-powered workflows. I regularly
                    challenge myself to learn new skills and adapt quickly to emerging paradigms, and I am eager to
                    leverage my expertise to contribute to a dynamic team.

                <h3>Leadership Approach</h3>
                <p>As a team leader, I adopt a hands-off approach focused on empowering my team to grow and succeed. My
                    leadership style involves breaking down overall projects into manageable subtasks and delegating
                    them based on priority. For high-priority tasks, I assign team members according to their specific
                    skills to ensure efficiency and speed up development. In contrast, for low-priority tasks, I
                    delegate responsibilities that challenge teammates by placing them slightly outside their current
                    skill set, fostering growth and skill enhancement. I remain accessible to provide guidance and
                    support when needed, promoting a learning environment while reinforcing team cohesion. This
                    structured delegation model allows me to prioritize both task completion and the professional
                    development of each team member, ultimately creating a strong and versatile team ready to tackle any
                    challenge.</p>
